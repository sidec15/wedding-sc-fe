You’ll see us as kids, with questionable faces, awkward poses, and outfits that might be trendy today… on Mars. Then came the years when we met and started writing our story together. The rest? It’s all here: hugs, holidays, silly moments, and memories that brought us to where we are now. This is our story: a mix of sweet, funny, and unforgettable moments. Scroll through and enjoy with us!"
