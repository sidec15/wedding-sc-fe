You’ll see us as kids, with questionable faces, awkward poses, and outfits that might be trendy today… on Mars. Then came the years when we met and started writing our story together. The rest? It’s all here: hugs, holidays, silly moments, and memories that brought us to where we are now. This is our story: a mix of sweet, funny, and unforgettable moments. Scroll through and enjoy with us!"

      "description": "Among the most striking elements of the church are two angels sculpted by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, originally intended for Ponte Sant'Angelo. Considered too beautiful to remain outdoors, they were brought here to be preserved. One angel holds the crown of thorns, a symbol of Christ's suffering; the other displays the cartouche with the inscription 'INRI', placed on the cross."

      "description2": "At this sight, I fell to my knees where I was. [...] I could barely fix my gaze on Mary's hands, and in them I saw the expression of forgiveness and mercy.",
      "description3": "[...] although she said no words to me, I fully understood the horror of the state I was in, the beauty of the Catholic religion, in a word, I understood everything.\"",

      "moving_background": "CONVERSION",
      "description1": "On January 20, 1842, a young French Jew named Alphonse Ratisbonne, known for his deep skepticism and anti-Christian stance, entered Sant'Andrea delle Fratte seemingly by chance. He had accepted a friend's dare to wear the Miraculous Medal, but what happened next changed his life forever: at the side altar, he saw the Virgin Mary.",
      "description2": "The experience moved him so profoundly that he converted to Catholicism, became a Jesuit priest, and dedicated his life to spreading the faith. His conversion, recognized as miraculous, became a powerful symbol of Marian devotion in the Church."

    "medal": {
      "title": "The Miraculous Medal",
      "moving_background": "MEDAL",
      "description1": "The Miraculous Medal originated from the apparitions of the Virgin Mary to Saint Catherine Labouré in 1830 in Paris. During one vision, Mary asked for a medal to be struck, promising that whoever wore it with faith would receive great graces. The medal depicts Mary standing on a globe, crushing a serpent, with rays of light symbolizing the graces granted. On the reverse appear two hearts (of Jesus and Mary) and the letter M intertwined with a cross.",
      "description2": "The medal spread rapidly, especially during a cholera outbreak. The most well-known case is the miraculous conversion of Alphonse Ratisbonne, a non-believing Jew who wore it mockingly and was struck by a vision of the Virgin. Today, the medal is a symbol of protection, faith, and spiritual conversion."
