He had accepted a friend's dare to wear the Miraculous Medal, but what happened next changed his life forever: at the side altar, he saw the Virgin Mary.",
      "description2": "The experience moved him so profoundly that he converted to Catholicism, became a Jesuit priest, and dedicated his life to spreading the faith. His conversion, recognized as miraculous, became a powerful symbol of Marian devotion in the Church."

Embracing solitude, prayer, and extreme poverty, he attracted followers drawn to his radical lifestyle of humility and penance. This would eventually lead to the birth of the Order of Minims."

Among his many wonders, one of the most beloved is the story of Martinello, a little lamb who followed him like a friend. When the lamb was unknowingly slaughtered, cooked, and served by a worker, Francesco wept and prayed and Martinello miraculously returned to life, a tender symbol of his compassion for all creation."

          "description": "The Minims are the only religious order that, in addition to the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, observe a fourth vow: \"perpetual Lent\", which means abstaining from meat and animal products. This choice embodies penance, sobriety, and daily conversion—renouncing excess to place God at the center and walk in solidarity with the poor and suffering."
